## Getting Started

Each exercise directory contains:
- `README.md` - Exercise instructions
- `starter/` - Initial code (if applicable)
- `solution/` - Reference implementation
- `AGENTS.md` - Project context for Codex
- `tests/` - Test specifications

## Recommended Order

1. Start with simple generation tasks
2. Move to refactoring exercises
3. Tackle multi-language projects
4. Try advanced integration scenarios

## Using Codex for Exercises

### Basic Workflow

```bash
# Navigate to exercise directory
cd java-spring-boot

# Review the AGENTS.md file
cat AGENTS.md

# Start Codex
codex

# Follow exercise instructions
```

### Tips for Success

1. **Read AGENTS.md first** - Provides context to Codex
2. **Use appropriate profiles** - Development vs production
3. **Start with sandbox mode** - Gradually increase permissions
4. **Review generated code** - Never blindly accept
5. **Run tests frequently** - Ensure correctness

## Exercise Completion Checklist

- [ ] Code compiles/runs without errors
- [ ] All tests pass
